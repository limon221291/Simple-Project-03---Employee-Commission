Write an Employee class that has two instance variables workingHours and
basicWage. There is also a method printWage to compute the total wage of an
employee and print the total wage. You can set an employee’s workingHours and
basicWage with the setInfo method or via a constructor. In addition, they will
receive a commission on the sales they generate while tending the counter. The
commission is based on the following formula: You have to also create an object
of Employee class from the main method. Take the values of workingHours,
basicWage and totalSales from the user(s). Set the employee’s workingHours and
basicWage with the setInfo method or via a constructor. Call printWage to show
the output.

Total wage = (commission rate * totalSales) + (workingHours * basicWage)


Sales Volume:                 Commission:
$1.00 - $99.99                  5%
$100.00 - $299.99               10%
>= $300.00                      15%
